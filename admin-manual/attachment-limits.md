The docker images provided by Reconmap come with some pre-defined limits that we consider reasonable for most of the use cases we have encounter. Some of the limits can be found below:

|Component|Minimum requirements|Recommended requirements|
|-|-|-|
|CPU|1 core|4 cores|
|RAM|1 GB|4 GB|
|Disk|25 GB|50GB SSD|

Considering the minimum requirements above you could install Reconmap on an cheap 5USD droplet in Digital Ocean, altough better specs would bring you and your team increased performance.
