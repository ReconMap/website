## History

There is an unwritten rule that says that after doing something manually for the third time, you should _automate_ it. We reached out to the same conclusion after completing our 4th or 5th pentest report. There is a lot of boilerplate and repetition that could be saved should a tool for managing security projects and their reports exist. We looked around for such tool on the open source community and to our surprise there weren't many complete pentest report generation tools, with the level of documentation, support, and feature set that we were looking for.

That's our history, we were born to get rid of the tedious work in an elegant way. We hope to provide some value to all the infosec professionals (individuals or teams) who are finding themselves spending as much time in reporting as in the actual security work.

## About the name

We picked the Reconmap name for two reasons:

- The pentest work starts typically with the reconnaissance phase (**recon** for short), and ends with a report of all the vulnerabilities, exploits and recommendations (the **map**).
- Reconmap contains the word **nmap** in its name, a tribute to our favourite [network mapper tool](https://nmap.org/).
